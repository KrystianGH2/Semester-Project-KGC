            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.

              We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
              brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
              different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
              explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
              with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
              dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
              everyone’s gone home).

                On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the
                Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum.
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience
                the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
                powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
                able to use and control wind to create power.
