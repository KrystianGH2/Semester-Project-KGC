# Semester-Project-KGC
Community Science Museum
    In this project, I will be summarizing the feedback I got from Hotjar and what changes I made. 
Starting from the most important part, the changes I made to improve my site were the input fields in pages (Login, sign up, contact page, and reservation).
At the interview with a (client) this case my friend, the first feedback I got was the size of the input fields, they were too small and hard to click. This was also shown in the Hotjar recordings. These were the points that I focused on, so to fix them, I made them bigger for every media query. I also added validation to the input fields to improve interactions for the user. 

Another feedback I got from the interview was about the contents of the main page (home page). Users were overwhelmed by how much there was on the home page, also the images were too small and the image placement was uneven. The improvement I made to fix these was by adding the images and text inside the card and making it hover to show, so in this case, the user can choose which one they wanna read or look at.
Titles are also improved as they were not aligned correctly while adjusting the site.
A fixed scroll-up button was added at the bottom of the page, to quickly move up back to the home page.
